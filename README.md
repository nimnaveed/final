# final
I created a calendar that displays, creates, deletes, and edits event(s) using data structures and java. The project displays an event(s) by day and or month, depending on user selection. Another major feature is that it stores both one-time and recurring events, and the user can edit or delete it and the program will print an output file of the final events after editing events.
